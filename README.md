# SM64 Last Impact Port

# File Structure

In behavior-data.lua there are behaviors, and (not so common) custom models, We load the model in the level script instead of defining it.

actions.lua is for mario's Custom actions.

bhv_anims.lua is for the custom lua animations.

hud.lua is the hud code.

streamed_music.lua contains code that can do streamed music based on level.

omm-game.lua contains code that registers the romhack to omm.

all the files that start with "yoshi-" means they are for rideable yoshi.

powerups.lua contains all of the powerups + the behaviors.

obj_overrides.lua is for when we want to add to an object.
